# How TSFix+ works

This document explains the design for anyone who wants to understand or change the code. It
assumes some familiarity with Direct3D 9 (devices, shaders, vertex buffers, Present).

## The problem

Tales of Symphonia (PC, 2016) advances its world exactly one step each time it presents a frame,
and limits itself to 30 frames a second. Raising the limit makes the whole game run faster:
battles, walking and cutscenes all go at double speed at 60. The game's logic can't simply run
faster.

So TSFix+ leaves the logic at 30 and adds frames **between** the game's own: for every
refresh of the display, it redraws the game's latest frame with each object moved partway back
towards where it was in the frame before. This is interpolation, done with the game's own draw
calls, not by processing images.

## The pipeline

```
TOS.exe ──▶ d3d9.dll (TSFix+) ──▶ the system's d3d9.dll
                │
                ├─ main.cpp         hooks the device's methods
                ├─ recorder.cpp     records each frame, can redraw it
                ├─ interpolate.cpp  pairs, blends, paces
                ├─ standalone.cpp   the game fixes TSFix used to provide
                └─ textures.cpp     TSFix-format texture packs
```

The game loads `d3d9.dll` from its own folder before Windows' one, so TSFix+ is loaded as the
game's Direct3D 9. It loads the real one, lets the game create its device, and replaces entries in
the device's method table (vtable) with its own functions. Each of those tells the recorder what
the game did and then calls the real method, so the game draws exactly as before. Present is the
exception: it goes to `presentFrame()` in `interpolate.cpp`.

TSFix+ can also still be loaded by Special K as its Direct3D 9 "proxy", with TSFix, as in
version 0.9 (on the game's 2016 launch version, which TSFix needs). Then TSFix provides the game
fixes and texture packs, and TSFix+ only smooths: `standalone.cpp` and `textures.cpp` do nothing
when `tsfix.dll` is loaded.

## The game fixes (standalone.cpp)

TSFix (by Kaldaien) found and fixed what the PC port gets wrong. TSFix itself no longer works on
the current Steam version: it hooks the game at fixed addresses from the launch version. TSFix+
fixes the problems the current version still has, finding each piece of the game's code by a
byte pattern that must occur exactly once, and leaving it alone if it doesn't:

- **The game's frame limiter** (a busy-wait until 1/30 s has passed; TSFix's pattern) returns at
  once. TSFix+ paces the game itself (below), and two limiters drift against each other.
- **The game's clock** counts 60 Hz ticks, with a rate in ticks per frame. The function that
  queues a rate change is found by a pattern, and the rate is kept at 2, as TSFix does.
- **The 60 Hz timer.** The game calls `CreateTimerQueueTimer` with `WT_EXECUTEONLYONCE` and a
  16 ms period; with that flag the period must be 0. The period is set to 0 (TSFix does the
  same). Left as it is, the videos, which run on this timer, stutter and break up into black
  blocks, more and more as they play.
- **Videos and the GPU.** The video player writes each video frame into its texture while the GPU
  may still be drawing the previous one from it. While nothing is blended (a video), each game
  Present waits for the GPU to finish (an event query).
- **The Zelos title achievement** is requested as `TROPHY_ID_ZELOSZ_TITLE_COMPLET`; the missing
  `E` is added (found by TSFix).
- **Window and focus.** Fullscreen is turned into a borderless window over the monitor (in
  exclusive fullscreen the game minimises on Alt+Tab and stops responding). If the resolution
  isn't the monitor's shape (16:9 on an ultrawide), the window keeps the picture's shape, centred,
  and a black window behind it covers the rest (black bars). Windowed mode gets a borderless
  window centred in the monitor's work area (above the taskbar), made smaller, keeping its
  shape, if it doesn't fit. The game moves its window back to its full size a moment later, so
  the window is held where TSFix+ put it (in `WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING`). The game never learns it lost focus (its window's
  activation messages are held back and user32's `GetForegroundWindow`, `GetFocus` and
  `GetActiveWindow` report its window), so it keeps running in the background. Its window is
  never "always on top" (it became so by being placed behind an always-on-top overlay window),
  so Alt+Tab shows the other window. DirectInput devices are set to non-exclusive, and the cursor
  is never confined to the window.

Windows functions are hooked by rewriting their first five bytes into a jump (the standard
hot-patch prologue, a jump stub into another DLL, or an existing hook such as the Steam overlay's,
which is chained). The game's import table is encrypted, so hooking it isn't possible.

## Texture packs (textures.cpp)

TSFix loads texture replacements from `TSFix_Res\inject`: loose `<crc32>.dds` files and `.7z`
archives of them, named by the CRC-32 of the texture file the game loads. TSFix+ reads the same
packs: `D3DXCreateTextureFromFileInMemoryEx` is hooked, the game gets its own texture at once, and
a worker thread decompresses the replacement (with the LZMA SDK's 7z decoder) and creates it. From
then on SetTexture draws with the replacement. The recorder keeps the game's own texture, so draws
pair between frames the same way before and after a replacement arrives (with the replacement in
the pairing key, objects jittered while textures streamed in).

## Recording a frame (recorder.cpp)

Between two Presents, every call that changes device state or draws is stored as a `Command`
in a `Frame`, with its data (constants, rectangles, and so on) in the frame's byte store. Two
details make a recording complete:

- **The starting state.** The game creates its device as a *pure* device, which can't be asked
  for its current state. So TSFix+ keeps its own copy of everything the game has set
  (`DeviceState`), and each frame starts with a snapshot of it.
- **Buffer contents.** The game rewrites some vertex buffers during a frame (characters, which it
  poses on the CPU, and a shared buffer for sprites and 2D). Every write to a dynamic buffer is
  recorded (`OP_VERTEX_WRITE`), so a redraw writes the same bytes at the same point.

A frame holds a reference to every object it uses, so nothing it needs is freed before a redraw.
All of them are released before a device Reset, which Direct3D 9 requires.

`replay()` applies the starting state and issues every command again, calling `ReplayHooks`
around each draw and buffer write; that is how interpolation changes what gets drawn. With no
hooks, a redraw is pixel-identical to the game's own frame. (This was verified by filling every
render target with a solid colour before redrawing and comparing every pixel.)

## Pairing draws between frames (interpolate.cpp, buildPlan)

To blend an object, TSFix+ has to find the same object in the previous frame. There are no
object names at this level, only draw calls, so a draw's identity is built from what it uses: the
render target, shaders, buffers and their offsets, the draw's arguments and its first texture
(`DrawInfo::key`). Draws with the same identity are paired in order. For the world's 3D objects
this pairs everything.

The game's vertex shaders kept their constant tables, variable names included, which tells
TSFix+ what each shader's constants are (`noteVertexShader` in `main.cpp`):

| Constants | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| c0-c3 | `mMatrixWVP` | object → screen |
| c4-c7 | `mMatrixWV` | object → camera |
| c8-c11 | `mMatrixW` | object → world |
| c16-c18 | `gCBuffer1` | light vectors (or outline width) |

Each object is drawn by up to three shaders: the colour pass, a depth pass (which TSFix's
outlines are built from) and an outline pass. All three are recognised by `mMatrixWV` in their
constant table, so an object's colour, depth and outline always move together.

## What is blended, and how

An in-between frame has a blend factor `alpha`: 0 is the previous frame, 1 the latest.

**Objects placed by matrices** (scenery, terrain, buildings, the camera): constants c0-c11 (and
c16-c18) are blended between the paired draws, set just before the draw and put back after it.

**Characters**: the game poses them on the CPU and rewrites their whole vertex buffer every
frame. When the previous frame wrote the same buffer range, positions and normals are blended
(the shaders renormalise normals). A mesh that moved further than its own size is taken to have
teleported and isn't blended.

**Sprites** (effects, grass, damage numbers, shadows, the target marker) need more care:

- They are rebuilt every frame in one shared, ring-like vertex buffer, so their buffer offsets
  never match between frames. They are paired by kind instead (same shader, texture and size,
  `DrawInfo::key2`).
- They are drawn **one triangle per draw**. A quad is two draws; a round shadow is a ring of
  about 16 thin triangles around a shared centre.
- All sprites share the camera's matrix, so blending that (c0-c3) keeps them with the scene when
  the camera moves, whatever the pairing. That is done for every sprite.
- Their own movement is written into their vertices. Blending that per triangle pulled shapes
  apart (triangles paired with the wrong partner), so sprites are moved as **whole pieces**:
  - **single pieces** (`PIECE`): the battle target marker (two halves) and the shadows under
    characters in towns and dungeons, recognised by the part of their texture they show (which
    stays the same with or without texture packs). Each is paired with the nearest of its kind in
    the previous frame and moved as one piece;
  - **rings** (`RING`): battle shadows, drawn as a ring of triangles around a shared vertex;
  - **everything else** (spell effects, particles, grass): grouped per kind (shader, texture,
    size) into shapes of triangles that share vertices.

  Rings and shapes are paired with the nearest shape of the previous frame and all their
  triangles move together. A piece or shape that moved further than its own size (a new
  particle, a burst) isn't moved. For "everything else", only shapes of similar size (within 2x)
  are paired, closer than the smaller one's size: a spell's ground circle that had just appeared
  otherwise paired with a smaller effect of the same kind above the caster's head.
- An indexed sprite draw's `MinIndex`/`NumVertices` arguments don't describe the vertices it
  uses (they say 0-2 while the index list points thousands further on), so the vertices are
  found from the draw's index list. Index buffers can't be read back from the GPU, so TSFix+
  keeps a copy of each as the game writes it (`gIndexCopies`).
- The shared buffer is written with `D3DLOCK_NOOVERWRITE`, a promise not to change data the GPU
  may still be reading. Moved sprite vertices therefore go into TSFix+'s own buffer, renewed
  for each in-between frame, and the draw reads from there.

**Never blended**: anything drawn with a flat (orthographic) projection, which is the HUD, menus
and on-screen text; sprites whose matrix changed a lot (animations such as the end-of-battle
text, which otherwise flashed across the screen); and everything during a camera cut, detected
when most objects' matrices change completely at once.

## Pacing (interpolate.cpp, presentFrame)

TSFix+ decides when the game gets to run, which makes it the frame limiter:

1. When the game presents frame N, a schedule advances by exactly 1/30 s. After a stall (a load,
   a hitch) the schedule restarts.
2. The desktop compositor, which puts images on screen in windowed and borderless modes, reports
   when the last refresh happened and the time between refreshes. An image presented between two
   refreshes appears at the second, and a later Present before then would replace it. So
   TSFix+ draws each in-between frame just after the previous one's refresh has passed, for
   the next refresh, with `alpha` taken from that refresh's time: one frame per refresh, on one
   continuous timeline across game frames.
3. It stops early enough for the game to produce frame N+1 on time, using a running estimate of
   how long the game takes per frame (frames longer than 1/30 s, such as loads, don't count
   towards it), then waits until the schedule says the game may continue.

With F9 off, the game's own frame is presented as it is and the same pacing applies, so the game
speed never changes. The game's own limiter is switched off (above); with TSFix, TSFix's limiter
must be set far above 30 (1000): at 60, its ticks drift against this schedule and hold back a
frame about every 20 game frames, longer than a refresh at 144 Hz. Direct3D 9's Present doesn't
wait for the display here, which is why the compositor's timing is used. Where the compositor
doesn't report its timing (possibly under Proton), the display's refresh rate is used instead.

## Changing things

- **A sprite that moves wrongly.** Most sprites are handled as generic shapes. One that needs
  its own rule can be recognised by the part of its texture it shows (its texture coordinates'
  bounding box) and added to `PIECE` if it's drawn as one piece, or `RING` if it's a ring or fan
  of triangles sharing a vertex. The texture coordinates can be read from a draw's
  vertices with a Direct3D 9 capture tool such as RenderDoc or apitrace, or by logging
  `Sprite::uvLo` and `uvHi` from `spriteOf()`.
- **Something blends that shouldn't.** Check how its draws are paired (`buildPlan`) and whether
  a guard applies: `flat()`, the size tests, `matrixChange()`.
- **Testing a change**: compare with F9, and watch `tsfixplus.log`. Its line every minute shows
  game frames per second (30.00 when pacing is right) and frames shown per second (close to the
  refresh rate when blending is running).
